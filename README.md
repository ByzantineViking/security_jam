Our Junction project, done in about 24h, with a team of five.
My contribution was all the graphics (Done in Adobe Illustrator), and the web view with JSX and CSS.

Cyber Security in a easy-to-understand format for kids - and such for everybody - to understand.

Our idea was a card game, where all the cards had 2 sides, one with the cyber threat/defense, to try to tell people what it's effects are, and on the other side an analogy to real life, so that people would relate hard concepts to easy real-life-examples.

But here comes the twist, it was also a time-travel game. Every other turn would be played in current times, and every other would be played in historical setting, where the analogies would be expressed.

Due to compatibility issues with the card-game-functionality library we decided to use, the development was halted for a major part of the available time. In the end we got MVP with just the nowadays era, with limited card interactions, but with viable combat system.
